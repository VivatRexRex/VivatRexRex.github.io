			<h2>About Mario</h2>

			<p>After I graduated high school I started working in retail and quickly realized it wasn't really my passion. I have always spent most of my time in front of a computer and have always wanted to learn how to code and create websites. I became interested in taking pictures so I started studying photography, and in doing so got in contact with models who were looking to create a website for themselves. I then realized that I could combine my love of photography and coding by creating websites for models or anyone looking to create a website.</p>
            <p> As a student of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey as a software developer and it's been amazing. I've truly learned so much from the program. </p>
			<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer who is very team friendly, and loves to work on projects day in and day out please reach out! I would love the opportunity to collaborate with other developers on anything. I'm a student first before anything else and absolutely love working. </p>
